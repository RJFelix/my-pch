#MyPCH
##My Pacific Coast Highway

MyPCH is a directory of places to see and things to do along the entire length of the Pacific Coast Highway, from San Diego, CA to Olympia, WA. 

At this point it's purely a notional directory - the project is for me to learn and grow as a developer. But it may grow to be something more in the future!

I'm doing this for three reasons:

1. Develop my React skills by working on a slightly bigger, more involved single-page app.
2. Learn Redux, even though it may not *really* be needed for this project.
3. I drove almost the entire length of the PCH in February 2016. I found the online resources left something to be desired - there's plenty of information out there, but it's scattered and disorganized. This project will eventually seek to correct that.

Thanks for checking it out!
